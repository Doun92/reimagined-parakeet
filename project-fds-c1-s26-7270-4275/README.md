Dear Learner,

**This is your project repository**


There is one folder for each final report to be produced. Inside each folder, you will find the *instructions*, the *data*, and a `README.Rmd` that you can use to write your project (code and markdown text).

**How to set up your project folder**


With the 5 steps here below, you can create on your computer (if not already done) a copy of your remote GitHub repository, and ensure a connection to it via an RStudio project.

1 - In RStudio menu bar: `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`

2- In Repository URL: provide the `link to your GitHub repository`. Please use the `SSH` link and not the `HTML` one.

3 - In `Create project as a subdirectory of`: specify the directory in which you want to place a copy of your remote GitHub repository.

4 - Click on `Create Project.`

5 - Verify that the content of your remote GitHub repository has been properly transferred to the folder you specified in step 3.

**Tips for planning your work**


When it comes to planning your work, please be mindful that the time from project *submission* to *graduation* takes at least 10 working days for a project that is in a good shape. So if your subscription renews on 1 February, you would need to submit on 16 January *the latest* if you want to graduate before that time. To make sure that your project is in a good shape, you can always check your work with an instructor during a 1-1.


**Checklist before submitting**
 
> Before submitting your project on the learning platform, make sure you have completed the following tasks:

- [ ] Have you responded to all the questions listed in the reports?
- [ ] Have you written your interpretation of the results?
- [ ] Does your repository contain one .Rmd file per report?
- [ ] Do all your reports `knit` without error?
- [ ] Do your plots contain a title, subtitle and readable axis titles?
- [ ] Are your tables properly displayed? (e.g., using `knitr::kable()`)
- [ ] Have you cited any code source that you might have used to complete the reports? (e.g., Stackoverflow)


**Tips for reaching out for support**


You can use the platform project page to *post questions as comments*. These will remain between you and the instructors and will not
spoil solutions to other learners.
When **adding code to the comments**, in order to render it well you can use three backticks (` ``` ` ) at the beginning and the end, just like in an `.Rmd` file.

Example

` ``` `
```

my code is nicely rendered
```
` ``` `

Important note: Do not add `{r}` after the first triple backticks.

Good luck, have fun, and as always we are here to help.
